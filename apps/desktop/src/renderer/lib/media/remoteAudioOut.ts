/**
 * Remote audio output (docs/02 «Deafen», echo rules 1–2): one plain <audio> per remote track,
 * WebRTC renders it; playback is only `element.muted` / `element.volume` and the output device
 * only `setSinkId` on the same elements. This class is the ONE place that writes them.
 *
 * Why it owns the elements instead of a fire-and-forget attach: deafen and the per-user volumes
 * must survive everything that touches an element behind our back (issue: a deafened user heard
 * the others when a charger / dock switched the macOS output):
 *  - LiveKit's own device handling: on `devicechange` the Room re-selects the output
 *    (`switchActiveDevice('audiooutput')` → `setSinkId` on our elements) and `Room.startAudio()`
 *    sets `muted = false` on every remote audio element;
 *  - `RemoteAudioTrack.attach()` / `setVolume()` write `muted` / `volume` too;
 *  - Chromium rebuilds the WebRTC audio renderer on a sink switch.
 * So: `apply` runs on every attach, after every sink change (ours or LiveKit's) and whenever an
 * element reports `volumechange` with a state that is not ours.
