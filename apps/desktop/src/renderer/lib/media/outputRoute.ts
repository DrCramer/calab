/**
 * Where remote voices play (CBF-108; docs/02 echo rule 2 — `setSinkId` on the same <audio>).
 * Pure: the caller passes the last `enumerateDevices()` snapshot and the choice from the prefs.
 *
 * Why this exists. Chromium mixes every remote WebRTC track of the page into ONE output
 * (`WebRtcAudioRenderer`): `setSinkId` on any single remote element moves all remote voices,
 * while the other elements keep reporting their old `sinkId`. A later `setSinkId` with that
 * unchanged id is a no-op by spec, so the voices stay where the stray call put them. UI sounds
 * are fresh elements on the chosen device — heard, while the voices are not. The stray writer
 * was LiveKit: its output id is fixed at `new Room()` and it re-applies it to every new remote
 * track (a participant joins, a reconnect re-subscribes). So LiveKit and our elements must
 * always get the same id, and that id must name a device that exists now:
 *  - the chosen device while it is present;
 *  - otherwise the system default — `'default'` where Chromium lists that alias (it follows the
 *    OS default and is what LiveKit falls back to), `''` elsewhere;
 *  - the list unknown (no snapshot yet, no device ids before permission): the choice as is.
 * A chosen device that went away (AirPods off) is thus left explicitly, not kept as the sink of a
 * renderer on a dead device; it is taken back when the device returns (`devicechange`).
